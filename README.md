# NF-Books

* This is a project made at the end of intensive Front-End Developer course: [CodersLab](https://www.coderslab.ro/)

* I started building this project with HTML and some pretty advanced CSS and later I started coding Sass.

* [NF-Books](https://sorinscouse.github.io/NF-Books/) it's a website, for a made up company that offers best selling books. The reader can choose from **MOST POPULAR PACKAGES** section, built with nice CSS animations. I created 3 animated cards using the most modern CSS techniques: when we hover these cards, they turn and then we can see a nice button that the user can click. As soon as the user hits that button, it opens like a pop-up. That is pure CSS, no JavaScript needed for all of this! 

* After that, we have the next section, which is for reviews. It has a nice video there, playing in the background.

* In the end, we have a forum that it does some great features, when someone starts filling out that field, the full name text it just slides down. Once again, this is CSS only.

* The website has a navigation, that it stays there all the time when we scroll. That is a fixed position and as soon as we hit it, it has a nice animation and then when we hover the items, it actually has another animation effect as well!

* Then there are custom-made designed radio buttons.

* And at the end, it's just a simple footer.

*There's lots of animation effects going on and a lot of cool design elements!
