# NF-Books

* This is a project made at the end of an intensive Front-End Developer course (CodersLab).

* I started building this project with HTML and some pretty advanced CSS and later I started coding Sass.

* [NF-Books](https://sorinscouse.github.io/NF-Books/) it's a website, for a made up company that offers best selling books. The reader can choose from **MOST POPULAR PACKAGES**
